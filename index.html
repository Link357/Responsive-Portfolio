            <p>I just started a coding bootcamp to learn to become a fullstack web developer. Before that I drove for Uber and Lyft. Although it was very intesting, it put too many miles on my car and wasn't making enough money to support myself. This is why I started on my path on a new career to become a developer</p>
            <br>
            <p>For fun I like to play tennis, and play video games. One particular game I've been playing lately is Pokemon Go. I enjoy meeting new people and used to play the original pokemon when it first came out.</p>
